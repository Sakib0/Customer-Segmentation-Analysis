# Customer Segmentation and RFM Analysis

This project focuses on customer segmentation and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using a real-world retail dataset. The goal is to identify customer clusters and analyze their purchasing behavior to provide actionable insights for business strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a retail transaction dataset containing:
- **InvoiceNo**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **StockCode**: Product code.
- **Description**: Product description.
- **Quantity**: Number of items purchased.
- **InvoiceDate**: Date and time of the transaction.
- **UnitPrice**: Price per unit of the product.
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Country**: Country of the customer.

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Removed missing values in `CustomerID`.
    - Filtered out transactions with negative or zero `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`.
    - Standardized `InvoiceNo` and `StockCode` formats.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Created a new feature `Total Amount` as `Quantity * UnitPrice`.
    - Converted `InvoiceDate` to datetime format for time-based analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Analyzed sales trends over time.
    - Identified top-selling products.
    - Visualized customer purchasing patterns.

4. **RFM Analysis**:
    - Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.
    - Standardized the RFM data using `StandardScaler`.

5. **Clustering**:
    - Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
    - Applied KMeans clustering to segment customers into distinct groups.

6. **Visualization**:
    - Visualized clusters using scatter plots.
    - Analyzed cluster centers and customer distribution.

## Key Features
- **RFM Analysis**: Understand customer behavior based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Group customers into clusters for targeted marketing strategies.
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Identify seasonal trends and top-performing products.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning and clustering.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment.

---

## Results
- Identified **4 customer clusters** based on RFM metrics.
- Visualized sales trends and top 10 best-selling products.
- Provided actionable insights for customer retention and targeted marketing.
